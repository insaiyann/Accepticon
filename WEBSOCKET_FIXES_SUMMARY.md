# WebSocket Connection Fixes for Azure Speech Service

## Issues Identified

The console errors show repeated WebSocket connection failures to Azure Speech Service:
```
WebSocket connection to 'wss://eastus2.stt.speech.microsoft.com/stt/speech/universal/v2?...' failed
```

## Root Causes

1. **Audio Logging Interference**: `enableAudioLogging()` was causing WebSocket connection instability
2. **Lack of Retry Logic**: No retry mechanism for transient WebSocket failures
3. **Poor Error Handling**: Generic error messages without WebSocket-specific diagnostics
4. **No Connection Health Checks**: No proactive detection of connectivity issues
5. **Suboptimal SDK Configuration**: Missing timeout and connection management settings

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Azure Speech Service Configuration
**File**: `src/services/azure/SpeechService.ts`

- **Disabled Audio Logging**: Removed `enableAudioLogging()` which was causing connection issues
- **Added Connection Timeouts**: Set proper initial and end silence timeouts (10 seconds each)
- **Improved Endpoint Configuration**: Set specific WebSocket endpoint URL for better routing
- **Added Profanity Filter**: Configured response profanity options

### 2. Retry Logic for WebSocket Failures
**New Method**: `transcribeWithRetry()`

- **3 Retry Attempts**: Automatic retry for WebSocket connection failures
- **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive delays (1s, 2s, 4s) between retries
- **Smart Error Detection**: Only retries WebSocket-related errors, not authentication issues
- **Cleanup Between Retries**: Proper resource cleanup before each retry attempt

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
**New Method**: `isWebSocketError()`

- **Specific Error Detection**: Identifies WebSocket vs. other types of errors
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Provides specific guidance for different error types
- **Debug Information**: Logs region, language, and troubleshooting suggestions

### 4. Network Connectivity Testing
**New Methods**: 
- `checkNetworkConnectivity()`: Tests HTTP connectivity to Azure endpoints
- `testConfiguration()`: Enhanced with better timeout and error detection
- `runDiagnostics()`: Comprehensive diagnostic suite

### 5. Diagnostic Tools
**New File**: `debug-websocket-connection.js`

A comprehensive diagnostic script that tests:
- Environment configuration (HTTPS, WebSocket support)
- Azure credentials and region settings
- Network connectivity to Azure endpoints
- Direct WebSocket connection testing
- Speech service availability

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Run the Diagnostic Script
```javascript
// In browser console, run:
debugWebSocketConnection();
```

### 2. Check Service Status
```javascript
// Check if service is properly initialized:
window.speechService?.getStatus();

// Run comprehensive diagnostics:
window.speechService?.runDiagnostics();
```

### 3. Monitor Console Logs
Look for these improved log messages:
- `‚úÖ Azure Speech Service configuration validated`
- `üåê Network connectivity to Azure Speech Service confirmed`
- `[STT] Transcription attempt 1/3` (shows retry logic working)

## Expected Improvements

1. **Reduced Connection Failures**: WebSocket connections should be more stable
2. **Better Error Recovery**: Automatic retry for transient failures
3. **Clearer Error Messages**: Specific guidance for different types of issues
4. **Faster Failure Detection**: Shorter timeouts for quicker error detection
5. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive diagnostic information

## Configuration Verification

Ensure your `.env` file has correct values:
```env
VITE_AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your_valid_key_here
VITE_AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=eastus2
```

## Troubleshooting Steps

If WebSocket issues persist:

1. **Run Diagnostics**: Use `debug-websocket-connection.js` script
2. **Check Network**: Verify internet connection and firewall settings
3. **Test Different Network**: Try from different network (mobile hotspot)
4. **Verify Credentials**: Ensure Azure Speech Service key is valid and not expired
5. **Check Azure Status**: Visit https://status.azure.com for service outages
6. **Browser Issues**: Try different browser or incognito mode
7. **HTTPS Requirement**: Ensure application is served over HTTPS

## Security Improvements

- Removed audio logging which exposed sensitive data in console
- Better error messages that don't expose full subscription keys
- Improved connection handling to prevent credential leakage

## Performance Improvements

- Faster failure detection with reduced timeouts
- Better resource cleanup between connection attempts
- More efficient retry logic that doesn't retry non-recoverable errors

These fixes should significantly improve the reliability of Azure Speech Service WebSocket connections and provide better debugging capabilities when issues occur.
